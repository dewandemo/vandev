title: QuickPresent
---

I threw together a quick and simple way to make a presentation on a mac using [Quicksilver](http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/) and [Camping](http://code.whytheluckystiff.net/camping) a while back.  Well, I finally got around to refining it and putting it into a both tiny and awesome package.  This puppy is made of two files, and makes presenting dead simple.  You just outline your thoughts in a text file, and QuickPresent smacks it onto your screen using Quicksilver's _largetype_ feature.  Not only that, but it also gives you a slick little web interface to show you what you've said, and what you're about to say.  Let me show you...

A few other slick features include automatically opening URL's and Files from your hard drive.  All you need is Camping and Quicksilver (with the _command line tool (qs)_ plugin installed).  Just type `camping quickpresent.rb` from the command line and your up running.  If you want to try something cheaper than Keynote or Powerpoint, play with QuickPresent.  Let me know what you think.
