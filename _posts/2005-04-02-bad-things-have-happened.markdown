title: Bad things have happened
---

The blog was down for over a day.  With all of the traffic I've been getting this is a huge deal...  Actually, I had a few other larger projects on the server that were down as well.  After around 3 hours on the phone with my father, it's all up and running again.

The downtime was due to a faulty cat5 cable, we believe.  It was ridiculous.  At first we figured it was the router so we bought a new one.  After playing with cat5 configurations we discovered it wasn't the router.  Our next step was to reboot the server.  I was biting my teeth.  The server had been running for 216 consecutive days (Debian!).  It booted smoothly and we're up and running now!

The experience will definitely force me to make more backups more often.  It's really difficult living in California and having your personal server in Iowa.  I'm blessed to have a father with time and patience.
