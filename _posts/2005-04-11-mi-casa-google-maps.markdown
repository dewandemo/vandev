title: Mi Casa... Google Maps
---

<a href="maps.google.com">Google maps</a> released it's new mapping program a few months ago.  Last week they added satellite imagery.  I thought this would be a great opportunity to share the unbelievable beauty that is Southern California.  Click on the thumb for a detailed look.  Life is good out here, but it's no Iowa.

<a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=3475+Roosevelt+St,Carlsbad+Ca&ll=33.154625,-117.345507&spn=0.005879,0.009291&t=k&hl=en">Try</a> google maps and check out Southern California.  Click on the map and drag, you can scroll wherever you like.  It's amazing.  Getting directions on the site is also very cool.  Google bought <a href="http://www.keyhole.com">Keyhole</a> a couple weeks ago.  I look forward to seeing what they do with the technology.  Currently only urban areas have high resolution.  It's like being in an airplane, and all using relatively simple built in technology.  For more about Google Maps and all of Googles cool new features check <a href="http://www.google.com/help/features.html#maps">this</a> out.  I'm sure they'll be getting a hold of me soon to create the next big thing :).
