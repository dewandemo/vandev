title: Mephisto is finally up and running
---

Dang, procrastination is a terrible terrible thing.  I had been doing allot of traveling prior to the Holidays and just didn't have the motivation needed to put the time into setting up [Mephisto](http://www.mephistoblog.com).  I finnaly got around to doing it, and it went pretty well.  The Typo conversion didn't happen as smoothly as I had hoped and I had to hack the Flickr plugin a bit to get her up and going, but she's finally here.  This time around I shouldn't rank as #1 on Google for a series of absurdly explicit terms describing grotesque sexual actions...  Thank you [Akismet](http://akismet.com).  I also decided to drop the blog from blog.vandev.com.  From now on, this is vandev.com.

I've got a couple new little projects that I'll release in the near future.  [Merb](http://merb.devjavu.com/) has entertained me as of late, as well as [MooTools](http://mootools.mad4milk.net/).  Anyway, I'll get them up and I'll finish polishing the site.  Polishing it until it shines.
