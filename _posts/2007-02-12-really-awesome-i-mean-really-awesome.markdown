title: Really awesome, I mean really awesome
---

So back on the 15th of December friend and fellow rubyist, [Kevin Clark](http://glu.ttono.us), forwarded me a job description from [Powerset](http://powerset.com).  Well, I applied to said job and long story short I'm starting tomorrow!  I drove a Budget rental truck up to San Francisco from San Diego on Friday.  I don't have a place yet... a slight problem which will hopefully be remedied very soon.  Anyway, we had an awesome [party](http://www.flickr.com/photos/yogurtboy/sets/72157594529172885) last night to celebrate the series A funding, and I'm excited to get started and settle into San Francisco.
