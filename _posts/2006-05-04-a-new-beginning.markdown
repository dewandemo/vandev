title: A new beginning
---

So, a little over a year ago, I started www.vanblog.net.  It was my first experience blogging, and I didn't really know what I wanted.  Well, I have a better idea now.  The problem with VanBlog was that it was either too personal or too tech for different audiences.  Enter, VanDev.  This is my effort to take the tech out of VanBlog.  I also needed a place to put projects that I'm working on a place to thrive...  I don't even know what that means.

I'll take this time to address questions:

1. Why VanDev?
 * Last name = Van Pelt, it's both dutch and awesome.

2. What's VanBlog?
 * That would be my personal blog now, where I talk about things like my feelings and changes occuring in my body.

3. VD?
 * VanDev, it's not what you think.

4. What's with these old entries?
 * They were brought over from VanBlog.

5. Do you where size 12 shoes?
 * Yes, as a matter of fact I do.

So, there it is.  I'll post something awesome soon about the design of this blog.  Oh, you just wait.
