title: Croppr podcast... a little late
---

The SDRuby [podcast site](http://podcast.sdruby.com) is filling up with great episodes.  One of which being my little talk on camping and [Croppr](http://www.vandev.com/croppr) (Episode 002 on the bottom).  The thing has been up for a couple of monthes now, but my posting consistency has been miserable lately.  I've had more [pressing issues](http://www.vanblog.net/archives/88-Wow,-its-a-record.html), but today is a new day.  My next project will be pushing this thing over to [Mephisto](http://www.mephistoblog.com).  I should also spend some time fixing the Rails date_select helper, but that's another post all together.  The next time I speak, the entire back end of this puppy will be different... totally awesome.
