title: Google maps continues to amaze me
---

I was browsing around today, and I found an interesting <a href="http://slashdot.org/articles/05/06/08/203208.shtml?tid=217&tid=1">article</a> on slashdot.  It had to do with third party uses of google maps, and google cutting down on them.  There turns out to be some amazing stuff being done google maps and third party software.  As mentioned earlier, there was the gps in the car use but these applications are just too cool.  My favorite was a tool that took craigslist rental listings and displayed them in your area dependent upon price.  There is also a site that points out sites to see from the satellite imagery.

In order of coolnees:

* [Housing Maps](http://www.housingmaps.com/)
* [Google Siteseeing](http://googlesightseeing.com/)
* [Chicago Crime](http://www.chicagocrime.org/)
* [Cheap Gas](http://www.ahding.com/cheapgas/)

Who knows what will pop up next???
